Movie Genre Prediction Model
This project involves creating a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. We utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings, combined with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-genre-prediction.git
cd movie-genre-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: IMDB Genre Classification Dataset. This dataset contains movie plot summaries along with their corresponding genres.

Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory of the project.

Feature Extraction
We use two primary techniques for feature extraction:

TF-IDF: This technique converts the textual information into numerical features based on the frequency of words and the inverse frequency of words across documents.
Word Embeddings: We use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to convert words into dense vector representations.
Model Training
We experiment with multiple classifiers to find the best model for genre prediction:

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification, extended for multi-class classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the hyperplane which best separates the classes.
Training Script
You can train the models using the provided script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --model <model_name> --feature <feature_type> --data data/genre_classification.csv
model_name: Choose from 'naive_bayes', 'logistic_regression', or 'svm'.
feature_type: Choose from 'tfidf' or 'word_embeddings'.
Evaluation
After training the models, we evaluate their performance using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation script will generate a detailed report:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py --model <model_name> --feature <feature_type> --data data/genre_classification.csv
Usage
To use the trained model for predicting the genre of new movie plot summaries, you can run the prediction script:

bash
Copy code
python predict_genre.py --model <model_name> --feature <feature_type> --input <input_text>
input_text: The plot summary of the movie you want to classify.
